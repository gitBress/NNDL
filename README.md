# NNDL
Neural Networks and Deep Learning projects

In these four projects I developed some deep learning applications. A brief description of each one of them follows, but for a more extensive one you can find the report in the corresponding folder. 

# Autoencoders for digit reconstruction
In this homework I train a neural network as an autoencoder on
the MNIST dataset. The goal is to find the right hyperparameters of the network, in order to
test the reconstruction capability of the autoencoder in standard MNIST images and in others,
corrupted with various levels of noise and occlusions.

# Handwritten digits classification
In this homework I classify the handwirtten digits provided in the
MNIST dataset. The goal is to find the right structure and hyperparameters of a feed-forward
neural network, in order to be able to classify the images with high accuracy.

# Reinforcement Learning
In this homework I train an agent to move in a simple grid world
(10x10 matrix) using a set of 5 basic actions (stay, move up, down, right, left). The goal is to
find a target position in the grid and, in order to do so, some parameters are tuned and two different approaches were analysed: Sarsa and Q-learning.

# Sequence modeling with RNN
In this homework I train a RNN that generates a text, based on the
book that is given as dataset. The goal is to find the right structure and hyperparameters of
the network, in order to avoid overfitting with the original dataset and generate a text with the
highest quality as possible.
